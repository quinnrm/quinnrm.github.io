There were several revisions of the bullet points I wrote for my work bio, and since the focus of the bullet points needed to be on technical skills, my soft skills were cut from the final list.

Bullet points which didn't make the cut:

  - Experienced professional with strong communication, problem-solving, and analytical skills.
  - Collaborative and adaptable individual with excellent emotional intelligence, open-mindedness, and proven ability to communicate effectively and resolve complex problems in a positive and constructive manner.
  - Possesses excellent communication skills, able to effectively collaborate in teams, and excel at problem-solving and analytical tasks.

It's unfortunate the soft skills were cut since my soft skills are some of my better skills, and I think they make me a valuable asset, especially in customer facing positions. Communication skills, emotional intelligence, and collaboration are important skills in the day-to-day as well because we all need to work with people on our team and people in other parts of the company.
